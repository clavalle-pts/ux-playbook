# UX Update

###### Where is PL on this project?
Half way through the project, nothing from development. Yet.
Where is legal on accessibility and responsiveness?

###### What are the actuals?

Testing environment is being established, technically this solves the opening conflict.
Design shift complete in 2016 as goal.

###### What is it, how much percent complete, what is being done?

Dashboards to show Stakeholders > 80%,
Dashboards with persona matching < 20%,
Navigation Redesign > 80%,
Navigation Recoding < 20%,

###### Challenges

Wasted time in meetings
Stakeholders needing KPIs
Wasted time in missed communications
Bad communications, overloaded terminology
Time zone challenges
Culture shift challenges
Mindset shift challenges
Microscopic perspective challenges
Scope creep
Change overload

###### Existing Pros, Next Steps
Formalized design culture, needs updating, re-training is involved

###### Concepts in play
Design Language - Specified in charter, covers responsiveness & accessibility, lowers risk, more efficient communications

###### Observational Recommendations
Develop KPIs, figure out how to communicate about this stuff without bogging down productivity, build in incentives for employees to want to achieve goal, not just so you can keep your job, it has be better than that. More creative inspiring atmosphere for coders, coding is hard work and a comfortable environment can help increase happiness and productivity.

### Approaches

#### #1 Follow, and stay with the bugs

###### Example Workflow
- Dan sends over screen
- UX design process pivots to UI and follows 'template' provided by Daniel (eg. onion skinning)
- Changes are submitted
- Dan makes changes
- Rinse and repeat

###### Risks
- Accessibility is harder to implement, due to hacky/patchy design process
- design for responsiveness likely gets put on the back burner, and then changes are being made after design work has been done
- Tightly coupled stack, performance limitations
- Design language is locked into technical limitations
- All based around one person, can only go as fast as that one person
- Leaves mobile un-integrated
- User experience likely remains disjoined and complex

#### #2 Lead and live 'bug-free'

###### Strategic Shift (Mindset & Culture)
- Hire one graphic designer to function as UI designer and to meet graphics design needs for UI and marketing
- UX shifts UI work to graphic designer and takes on function as interim project manager
- Shorter Iterations, More Iterations
- Hire/Promote two new/existing resources/front-end developers to code UX specs into the Java templates
- Hire one full-stack developer to cross-train with additional resources and code the modern front-end into TEAMS APIs
- Plano builds APIs
- Database teams works to optimize queries throughout
- Report team works with Ops to optimize report queries
- Build out new front-end for 80% of users, leave existing teams style as is and in tandem.

###### Example Workflow (1 Week Iteration)
- (Monday - Wednesday) Screen(s) is/are requested, graphic designer assembles and builds UI views based on design language
- (Tuesday - Thursday) Front-end developers work with graphic designer to code Java templates in tandem with design
- (Wednesday - Thursday) Full-stack developer works with Plano office and Austin Ops department to connect front-end view to TEAMS APIs.
- (Thursday - Friday) Consultants perform QA and Testing
- (Friday - Monday) Final screens are presented to management for review and approval.

###### Benefits
- Unified user experience
- Modern practices, better product
- Agile response in case of competitive landscape changes

###### Notes

Plano is one culture, Austin is another. These need to mesh better and
flow. If Romania is going to be a part, it needs to flow with. Management needs to ensure everyone is in the same place, dedicate the needed resources to do the job and get out of the way.
