UX Update

Where are we?
Half way through the project and not one thing from development.

What is real?

Testing environment is being established.

Dashboards
Workbench
Landing pages based on personas

Challanges

Wasted time in meetings
Meetings in general
Meetings
Ownership in project

Wasted time
40 days and counting
Bad communication
Time zone challange
Culture shift challange
Mindset shift challange
Microscopic perspective challange
Scope creep
Change overload
Non-creative atmosphere

Pros, Next Steps
Formalized design culture, needs updating
High-quality staff
Weekly Iterations, Project Manager, Developer to code views

Reccomendations
Less hands-on management in role
Develop KPIs, figure out how to communicate about this stuff

-or-

Refactor from what Daniel is doing, convert UX role to UI role and try to make
it look like something.

Risks
Accessibility
Responsiveness
Not Modern
Patchy
Hacky
Framework remains tightly coupled
Design language is locked into technical limitations

-or-
Keep UX going, keep feeding it to dev. Be patient. Trust yourselfs. Together and figure how to measure this thing. Think bigger. Design solutions for 21st century education. Get on board. 

Strategic Mindset Shift
If UX shifts to UI, an additional person will be needed to manage the project.

Programming is one culture, Austin is another. These need to mesh better and
flow. Romania needs to flow. Get everyone in the same place. Stop what you are
doing. Your in a 'busy' loop.
